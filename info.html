    This site is totally legit. You have no right to complain from anything or if we took your money its your problem
    being so dum for not looking down here to the small text. We now own your house and all of your toiletpaper so good
    luck going to the toilet. Also to
    make things easier we have sent you an e-mail where we ask your personal details and credentials (write clearly
    please!). Doge coins or
    other cryptocurrencies can also be used to get you out of this mess (Please we need the money as all of us have
    angered the local authorities wearing orange overalls in public). P.S We don't own any of these pictures on this website.
