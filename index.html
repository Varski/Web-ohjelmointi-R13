                are the top of the line in the industry and we have one of the best customer feedback the industry has
                seen to this day.

                have been demoted to miserable sofa sleeper. Worry not we will take you away from the misery of the
                casual life and give you the ride of your life. After our taxi journey you are free from the mortal
                bounds! Check our app (work in progress) and other sites for more information on this matter. See you in
                the taxi (and probably in court!)

        This site is totally legit. You have no right to complain from anything or if we took your money its your
        problem
        being so dum for not looking down here to the small text. We now own your house and all of your toiletpaper so
        good
        luck going to the toilet. Also to
        make things easier we have sent you an e-mail where we ask your personal details and credentials (write clearly
        please!). Doge coins or
        other cryptocurrencies can also be used to get you out of this mess (Please we need the money as all of us have
        angered the local authorities wearing orange overalls in public). P.S We don't own any of these pictures on this
        website.
