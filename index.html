                casual life and give you the ride of your life. After our taxi journey you are free from the mortal
                bounds! Check our app (work in progress) and other sites for more information on this matter. See you in

            This site is totally legit. You have no right to complain from anything or if we took your money its your
            problem
            being so dum for not looking down here to the small text. We now own your house and all of your toiletpaper
            so
            good
            luck going to the toilet. Also to
            make things easier we have sent you an e-mail where we ask your personal details and credentials (write
            clearly
            please!). Doge coins or
            other cryptocurrencies can also be used to get you out of this mess (Please we need the money as all of us
            have
            angered the local authorities wearing orange overalls in public). P.S We don't own any of these pictures on
            this
            website.
